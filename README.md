# General_DataBase_Appendabel
 create a sort of database that can handle a university, factory, hotels and etc. so that Once I open the program it shows me a selection menu to choose what kind of database I shall use. Then I can manage the selected database, like adding a new element search or find a specific element by name, roll ID age, etc.
